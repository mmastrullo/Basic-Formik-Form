# Basic Formik Form

## Description: 
This code uses the Formik library to validate form fields.

## How to Run:
1. Start by downloading all files in the same folder on your machine. 
2. Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path)
3. Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
4. Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser.

## Future Improvements:
For a more indepth form, I would like to add a number of other fields (name, location, age etc...) Additionally it would be nice to implement validate.js to ensure the email address is valid.
